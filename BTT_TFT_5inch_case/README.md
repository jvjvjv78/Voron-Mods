Case for BigtreeTech TFT 5" screen. This case can be attached to any 2020 profile like most 3D printers. This display requires a Raspberry Pi to work.

I initially designed this case to be placed on a Voron 1.8, the strong inclination of the screen allows not to interfere with the opening of the transparent doors.

To make this case, you need :

The 3D printed files (be careful, the two feet are different)
The 5" touchscreen from BigTreeTech
* 10 x M3x5x4 inserts or similar
* 6 x M3x5mm screws
* 4 x M3x8mm screws
* 4 x M2.5 screws provided with the screen

Fusion 360 files are also available if you want to make any modifications to the case.
